openstack notes.....

Keystone
Provides identity and its intergrated functions
for authentication, catalog services and policies 
to register and manage different tennants and
users in an opentacks prorject.
Ensures the right api requests are processed

Swift
Cloud storage! It is an object storage software
Advantages:
1) No central brain( no sigle point of failure )
SPOF
2) Curative indicates autorevovery in case of 
failure
3) Highly scalable for large petabytes store 
sccess by scaling horizontally
4) Better performance, which is ashieved by 
spreading the load over the storage nodes.
5) Inexpensive harware can be used foir redundant
storage clusters.
You can store virtual disks, images, backup archiving


Glance
Stores the metada of images. Infomation like kernel,
disk images, disk format. It is an image registry.
It queries images from Image Service API provided
by glance.

Cinder
Management of the persistence block storage.
It presents block-level storage provides raw volumes
that can be built into logical volumes in the 
file systems and mounted in the virtual machine.
Features:
1) Volume management
 a) create and delete volumes
2) Snapshot Management
 a) create and delete snapshot volumes

You can attach/delete volume.
You can clone volume
You can crate volume from snapshots
You can copy images to volumes

Types of storage based on an expectation
Performance   -> Block Storage
Database      -> Block Storage
Restoraing Backup ->  Object and Block Storage
Setup for Volumes providers -> Block Storage
Persistance -> Object and Block Storage
Access  -> Anywhere snd within the VM
Image store -> object Storage

Cinder features are delivered by orchestrating 
volume providers through setup driver's architecture
IBM, netapp, Nexenta, and Vmware
